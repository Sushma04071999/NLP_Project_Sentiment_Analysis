# NLP_Project_Sentiment_Analysis
Semantic Analysis of Restaurant Reviews
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify restaurant reviews based on sentiment (positive or negative). The dataset contains user reviews of restaurants, and the goal is to predict whether the review has a positive or negative sentiment using machine learning models.

# Project Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of two columns:
Review: The text of the review.
Liked: A binary label indicating whether the reviewer liked the restaurant (1 = positive, 0 = negative).

# Workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Converted the reviews into a numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.

2. Modeling:
Built and trained machine learning model Naive Bayes to classify the sentiment of the reviews.

3. Evaluation:
Evaluated the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Key Features:
Sentiment analysis of textual reviews using NLP.
Binary classification model to predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews.
Data visualization for understanding the distribution and key insights from the reviews.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,000 restaurant reviews from various customers. Each review is labeled as either positive (Liked = 1) or negative (Liked = 0).
